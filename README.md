# 14-Days-Of-Solidity

This repository contains the code for '14-Days-0f-Solidity' organized by [abc0xmattyic3333](https://twitter.com/abc0xmattyic3333)

The core contents will provide you with an introduction to Ethereum (EVM), and the Solidity programming langauge.

# What is Blockchain?

A blockchain is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records called blocks. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data. By design, blockchains are inherently resistant to modification of the data.
<br>

# What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is a decentralized platform that runs smart contracts: applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship, fraud or third-party interference.

<br>

# What is Solidity?

Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Smart contracts are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.

# What is a Smart Contract?

A smart contract is a computer protocol intended to digitally facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or performance of a contract. Smart contracts allow the performance of credible transactions without third parties.
<br>

# What is Remix?

Remix is an online IDE (Integrated Development Environment) to write smart contracts. It can compile and deploy smart contracts to the EVM.

# What is Tenderly?

Tenderly is an all-in-one Web3 development platform that accelerates smart contract development and provides a fully integrated developer experience. It combines in-depth debugging tools with observability and blockchain infrastructure.

# What is Gas?

Gas is a fee that is paid to the miners for each transaction that is executed on the Ethereum network. Gas is paid in Ether (ETH).
<br>

# What is a Transaction?

A transaction is a message that is sent from one account to another account. It can contain data and Ether (ETH).
<br>

# What is a Script?

A script is a program written in a scripting language that is interpreted by a scripting engine. The interpreter executes the script, which can automate the execution of other programs.
<br>

# What is a Library?

A library is a collection of functions that can be used by other contracts. It is similar to a class in object-oriented programming. A library is deployed to the blockchain and its address is stored in a variable.
Two Popular Libraries are: Web3.js and ethers.js.

What is a Node provider? A node provider is a service that provides access to the Ethereum network. It is a service that allows you to connect to the Ethereum network and interact with it.
<br>

# What is a Node?

A node is a computer that is connected to the Ethereum network. It is a computer that is connected to the Ethereum network and is running a client that allows it to interact with the network.
<br>

# What is a Client?

A client is a program that is used to interact with the Ethereum network. It is a program that is used to interact with the Ethereum network and is used to send transactions, deploy contracts, and query the state of the blockchain.
<br>
# What is a Wallet?

A wallet is a software program that is used to store, send, and receive digital currency. It is a software program that is used to store, send, and receive digital currency. It is also used to interact with decentralized applications.
<br>

# What is MetaMask?

MetaMask is a browser extension that is used to interact with the Ethereum network. It is a browser extension that is used to interact with the Ethereum network and is used to send transactions, deploy contracts, and query the state of the blockchain. It is also used to interact with decentralized applications. It is also available as a mobile application for both Android and iOS.

# What is a DApp?

A DApp is a decentralized application that runs on a blockchain network. It is a decentralized application that runs on a blockchain network and is used to interact with the blockchain.

# What is a Faucet?

A faucet is a website that dispenses small amounts of cryptocurrency to its users. It is a website that dispenses small amounts of cryptocurrency to its users. It is used to test smart contracts and applications. Testnet faucets are used to get free testnet Ether (ETH).
